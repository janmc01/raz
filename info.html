    <h1>What is RAZ?</h1>


    <p class="subtitle">
        RAZ started as a small Discord server and has grown into a connected ecosystem of community, games and tools.
    </p>


    <p class="raz-story">
        What began as a simple Discord server slowly evolved when custom Discord bots were added and automation became part of the experience.
        Soon after, a personal Minecraft server was launched — first running on a laptop, later moved to dedicated hosting.
        Today this Minecraft project is part of a three-server network.
        <br><br>
        As streaming on Twitch started and the audience grew, the Discord transformed into a real community hub.
        Members now use it to chat about their favorite topics, join Minecraft events and parties, and receive live stream and server updates.
